Russia has been subject to major terrorist attacks starting from a series of explosions that hit Moscow apartment blocks in 1999, followed by the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002 and the Beslan school siege in 2004.[27][28] There have been at least a half-dozen attacks in or near Moscow by Muslim terrorists, most of them Chechen militants, over the past 25 years.[29]

The Islamic State has also carried out coordinated, large-scale attacks on music venues throughout Europe since the 2010s, including a similar attack in Paris during a rock concert at the Bataclan theater in November 2015, as well as claiming responsibility for the bombing at the Manchester Arena in England in 2017. In October 2015, Islamic State militants downed a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, killing all 224 people on board.[27] It was also responsible for the bombing of the Russian embassy in Kabul in 2022.[30]

Russia had targeted the Islamic State during its intervention in the Syrian Civil War on behalf of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.[31] After years of reduced activity, the Islamic State has been trying to step up its attacks.[32] On 3 January 2024, IS–KP conducted bombings in Iran that killed at least 103 people; the US warned Iran of the possible attack.[32] Colin Clarke from the independent Soufan Center think tank said that IS–KP "has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda."[27]

On 2 March 2024, six alleged Islamic State militants were killed in a shootout with Russian security forces in Ingushetia.[33]

Prior warnings from other countries
On 7 March 2024, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced that it had neutralized a terrorist cell linked to IS in Moscow, which had intended to attack a synagogue in the city.[34] Hours later, the United States Embassy in Moscow warned that "extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts" and advised US citizens to "avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours,"[35][36][37] to avoid crowds, to stay updated by monitoring local media, and to maintain awareness of surroundings.[35] That day, the US also privately warned Russian officials of the danger of an impending attack from IS–KP from intelligence gathered earlier in March, under the US intelligence community's "duty to warn" requirement.[38][32] US officials later stated to The New York Times that the attack was related to the prior US warning,[37] and also said that the intelligence reports that the warning was based on had been shared with Russian officials before the attack.[27] In contrast, the Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said that in regards to the attacks "no concrete information, nothing was passed to us",[38] while the head of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, said that the US warning was "of a general nature".[39]

Canada and the United Kingdom also issued similar warnings to their citizens in Russia.[40] Three days before the Crocus City Hall attack, President Putin told the board of the FSB that Western warnings of a potential attack inside Russia were "provocative" and "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilise our society".[41]
