LDS missionaries briefly visited Asia in 1851[2]: 43  Three missionaries—Hosea Stout, James Lewis, and Chapman Duncan—arrived in Hong Kong, which was, at that time, a British colony, on April 28, 1853.[3] Missionary efforts in Hong Kong did not succeed, as both locals and colonists did not welcome the religious message and the local climate, culture, and language posed problems for proselytism.[2]: 43  The three missionaries could not afford to learn the language and received negative press coverage in Hong Kong.[3] Meanwhile, another religious movement, the God Worshipping Society, instigated the Taiping Rebellion, preventing missionaries from going to the mainland.[2]: 43 [3] The missionaries left on June 22, 1853; no further missionary activities were conducted in China in the 19th century.[3]

In 1910, missionary Alma O. Taylor visited China. His report to church leaders on the possibility of a proselytization campaign was negative.[2]: 43 

1921 visit by LDS Church leaders
Future LDS Church president, David O. McKay, travelled to China with Hugh Cannon in 1921, symbolically consecrating China to missionary efforts without beginning an actual missionary campaign.[2]: 43–44 [4]: 42  Cannon wrote that in the aftermath of China's ongoing famine, unrest, and recent humiliations on the part of foreign powers, China needed "someone to plead her cause before the throne of grace."[4]: 42  McKay's dedicatory prayer hoped for political stability and a cessation of superstition.[4]: 43 

The People's Republic of China
In 1949, the LDS Church began missionary activities in Hong Kong and Macao, but was unable to visit the mainland due to the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.[5][2]: 44  The Chinese Civil War and the Korean War hampered the missionary efforts.[5] The Hong Kong mission, with 9 missionaries and 14 Chinese converts, closed on February 6, 1951.[5]

In 1956, missionary activities returned in Hong Kong and were initiated in Taiwan.[5] Since then, the church has experienced "stable and moderate growth" in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao.[2]:
