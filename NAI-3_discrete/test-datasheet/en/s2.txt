Welcome to our comprehensive guide on building an Object Detection (Object Detection) Model using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) — an advanced deep learning technique that has revolutionized computer vision tasks.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of creating an Object Detection model using YOLOv8, step-by-step. From downloading the dataset into google Colaboratory to training your model and making predictions, we’ve got you covered.

Object Detection is pivotal in ensuring workplace safety, particularly in industries like construction and manufacturing. YOLOv8 enables real-time detection of safety helmets with remarkable precision and speed, making it a preferred solution for enhancing safety protocols in high-risk environments.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a solid understanding of how YDefines a dictionary named file_dict containing the following key-value pairs:
‘train’: the path to the training data directory, formed by joining the ‘dataDir’ variable with ‘train’.
‘val’: the path to the validation data directory, formed by joining the ‘dataDir’ variable with ‘valid’.
‘test’: the path to the testing data directory, formed by joining the ‘dataDir’ variable with ‘test’.
‘nc’: the number of classes, derived from the ‘num_classes’ variable.
‘names’: a list of class names, derived from the ‘classes’ variable.
Opens a file named ‘data.yaml’ in write mode within the ‘workingDir’ directory. Writes the content of the file_dict dictionary into the 'data.yaml' file using the YAML format. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one.OLOv8 works and how to implement it in your own projects. So, let’s dive in and unleash the pConstructs a dictionary named class_idx using a dictionary comprehension. It maps each string representation of an integer index str(i) to the corresponding class name classes[i] for every integer i in the range from 0 to num_classes - 1.

Initializes two empty dictionaries: class_stat and data_len.
Iterates over each mode in the list ['train', 'valid', 'test'].
Initializes a dictionary named class_count with class names as keys and initial counts set to 0 for each class.
Constructs the path to the labels directory for the current mode.
Iterates over each file in the labels directory.
Reads the lines of the current file and extracts the class information. It updates the counts of each class based on the extracted information.
Calculates the total number of data points (files) for the current mode and stores it in the data_len dictionary.
Stores the class count statistics for the current mode in the class_stat dictionary.ower of YOLOv8 together!
