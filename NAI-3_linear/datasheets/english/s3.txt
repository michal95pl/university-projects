Russia has been subject to major terrorist attacks starting from a series of explosions that hit Moscow apartment blocks in 1999, followed by the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002 and the Beslan school siege in 2004.[27][28] There have been at least a half-dozen attacks in or near Moscow by Muslim terrorists, most of them Chechen militants, over the past 25 years.[29]

The Islamic State has also carried out coordinated, large-scale attacks on music venues throughout Europe since the 2010s, including a similar attack in Paris during a rock concert at the Bataclan theater in November 2015, as well as claiming responsibility for the bombing at the Manchester Arena in England in 2017. In October 2015, Islamic State militants downed a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, killing all 224 people on board.[27] It was also responsible for the bombing of the Russian embassy in Kabul in 2022.[30]

Russia had targeted the Islamic State during its intervention in the Syrian Civil War on behalf of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.[31] After years of reduced activity, the Islamic State has been trying to step up its attacks.[32] On 3 January 2024, IS–KP conducted bombings in Iran that killed at least 103 people; the US warned Iran of the possible attack.[32] Colin Clarke from the independent Soufan Center think tank said that IS–KP "has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda."[27]

On 2 March 2024, six alleged Islamic State militants were killed in a shootout with Russian security forces in Ingushetia.[33]

Prior warnings from other countries
On 7 March 2024, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced that it had neutralized a terrorist cell linked to IS in Moscow, which had intended to attack a synagogue in the city.[34] Hours later, the United States Embassy in Moscow warned that "extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts" and advised US citizens to "avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours,"[35][36][37] to avoid crowds, to stay updated by monitoring local media, and to maintain awareness of surroundings.[35] That day, the US also privately warned Russian officials of the danger of an impending attack from IS–KP from intelligence gathered earlier in March, under the US intelligence community's "duty to warn" requirement.[38][32] US officials later stated to The New York Times that the attack was related to the prior US warning,[37] and also said that the intelligence reports that the warning was based on had been shared with Russian officials before the attack.[27] In contrast, the Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said that in regards to the attacks "no concrete information, nothing was passed to us",[38] while the head of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, said that the US warning was "of a general nature".[39]

Canada and the United Kingdom also issued similar warnings to their citizens in Russia.[40] Three days before the Crocus City Hall attack, President Putin told the board of the FSB that Western warnings of a potential attack inside Russia were "provocative" and "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilise our society".[41]

On 22 March 2024, the Russian band Picnic was scheduled to play a sold-out show at Crocus City Hall.[46][47] At around 20:00 MSK (UTC+3),[48] before the band began their performance, masked gunmen in combat fatigues opened fire on the crowd using AK–style assault rifles.[27][49] An IS–KP report also claimed that the assailants had pistols and knives.[1] Because the show was about to begin, some believed the initial sound of gunshots was part of the act.[50] At the time of the attack, children and teenagers were also in the building for a ballroom dancing competition.[51] The venue's security guards were unarmed, and it is believed that some of them were among those killed in the attack.[52] A part-time cloakroom assistant, 15-year-old Islam Khalilov, reportedly helped save more than a hundred concert-goers by showing them an exit through the venue's office space.[53] He was assisted by three of his co-workers, 14-year-old Artyom Donskov, Nikita Ivanov and another.[54]

One witness described the attackers as bearded men.[55] Amateur video footage verified by BBC Verify showed masked gunmen shooting indiscriminately in the entrance hall and auditorium.[56][57] Other footage posted to Telegram showed men in military fatigues and baseball caps firing into crowds of screaming people.[28] On 23 March, IS–KP released a video through Amaq News Agency, showing the shooting and throat-slitting of victims in the attack. In the video, the assailants appear to shoot patrons outside the entrance of the auditorium. In Arabic subtitles, the assailants were heard shouting; "come, come quickly",[a] "bring the assault rifle, bring the assault rifle",[b] and "kill them and have no mercy".[c][2][15] After shooting the victims, an assailant slits the throat of a still-alive wounded victim, who was shot off-camera prior to the recording. After the killings, in Arabic subtitles, one of the assailants is reported to have stated: "The infidels are defeated by the grace of Allah. Allah is great.. [sic] The infidels are defeated. We went out for the sake of Allah and are supporting his religion."[d][2][58]

The assailants were also reported to have used incendiary devices, with an eyewitness claiming the assailants used petrol bombs to start a fire in the auditorium.[51] Amateur video footage posted to social media sites showed huge fires and plumes of smoke coming from the building from the fires set by the assailants,[28] including by an emergency stairwell, forcing people towards the attackers' positions in the middle of the lobby.[15] The fire in the complex was estimated to have covered an area of 12900 square metres (139000 square feet).[59] Hours later, around 22:14 MSK, a loud sound was reported, followed by a partial roof collapse.[60] Moscow Oblast governor Andrey Vorobyov said the roof over the hall had collapsed.[61]

Specialized police units from the Special Rapid Response Unit (SOBR) and Special Purposes Mobile Unit (OMON) were sent to the scene,[62] arriving over one hour after the shootings started, according to Nexta.[63] Their arrival was delayed by traffic jams caused by the rush-hour, with the venue having been located on the Moscow Ring Road.[64][65] Vorobyov went to the scene to set up a task force to handle the situation.[28] Other officials also arrived, including Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev.[44] The National Guard of Russia was also dispatched to search for the assailants,[56] with a picture posted of the suspected assailants fleeing in a white 2007 Renault Symbol car with Russian license plates T668UM 69 (Tver Oblast), which they had purchased on 4 January 2024.[66]


Emergency services responding to the attack
Survivors were evacuated via medical helicopters,[67] with 70 ambulance crews reportedly being dispatched.[55] An unknown number of people fled to the parking area from the stage, while others fled to the roof.[9] Authorities evacuated approximately 100 people hiding in the basement.[23] A survivor said that escapees were hampered by locked doors, forcing some of them to break a door open to escape.[68] Firefighters prevented the fire from spreading,[69] while three helicopters were deployed to dump water on the burning rooftop.[70]

By 07:00 on 23 March, Vorobyov reported the fire had been contained and mostly extinguished.[71] He released a video showing extensive damage to the building with the roof and upper rows of the concert hall completely collapsed.[72] By 11:30 that same day, the fire had been extinguished.[73]

The attack left at least 144 dead[79] with a number subsequently dying of their wounds,[3] and 360 more injured, some critically.[16][80][49][81][82] Aside from gunshot wounds, some of the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation.[83] According to the Russian Minister of Health, Mikhail Murashko, five children were injured in the attack.[81] At least three children were killed,[84] while the oldest fatality was a woman in her 70s. Most of the victims were from the northwestern edge of Moscow, including Krasnogorsk and Khimki.[83] Three citizens of Belarus,[76][74] two from Kyrgyzstan,[75] and one each from Moldova,[78] Armenia[85] and Azerbaijan[86] were among those killed.

The search for victims ended on 23 March.[87] The health department of Moscow said it expected to finish identification of bodies in two weeks.[44] As of 30 March, 134 fatalities have been identified.[88]

The members of Picnic posted on Instagram that they and their management were "alive and safe",[89] with TASS later reporting that they had been evacuated.[90] However, the band later said on VK that one of the band's staff members was missing;[91] the band's assistant director was on the merchandise stall and died in the attack.[92]

Investigation
As of 23 March, 11 people have been detained, including the four suspected assailants in a white car, who were captured[93] on the 376th kilometer of the M3 highway leading to the Ukrainian border (140 kilometers (85 miles) away), near the village of Khatsun [ru] in Bryansk Oblast,[94] and about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southwest of Moscow, on the evening of 22 March.[95][96][31] Russia coordinated with Belarusian security forces to prevent the suspects from crossing the Belarus–Russia border.[97][98] The Investigative Committee of Russia launched a criminal terrorist probe into the attack.[99] Officials later said that the attackers were not Russian citizens.[100]

State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein said that Tajik passports were discovered in the vehicle of the individuals in custody,[31] and the Russian Telegram channel Baza identified the four attackers as citizens of Tajikistan.[101][102] The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan denied the involvement of three of its citizens, stating that the individuals named in the discovered passports had returned to Tajikistan months earlier and were working there.[103][104] In a phone call with Putin, Tajikistani President Emomali Rahmon said that "terrorists have no nationality, no homeland and no religion".[105] As Tajikistan signed a dual citizenship agreement with Russia in the 1990s, it is possible that the perpetrators held dual Tajik and Russian citizenships.[106]

On 24 March, four suspects, Dalerjon Mirzoyev, 32; Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, 30; Shamsidin Fariduni, 25; and Muhammadsobir Faizov, 19, appeared at Basmanny District Court in Moscow and were charged with terrorism.[107][56][108][109] Mirzoyev, Rachabalizoda, and Fariduni pled guilty during the hearing.[110] All showed signs of having been tortured.[111] They had facial injuries and bruises and Rachabalizoda appeared with a bandage covering his missing right ear.[112] Faizov was brought into court in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown, and appeared to have an eye missing. They were ordered to remain in pre-trial detention until at least 22 May.[113]

A short video on Telegram allegedly showed Rachabalizoda being tortured by FSB agents, who cut off his ear and forced him to eat it.[114][58] In another interrogation video released by Russian state media, Fariduni said that he participated in the attack in exchange for 1 million rubles ($11812), half of which he claimed to have already received by card transfer from individuals who contacted him on Telegram and whose identities he did not know.[115] He also said he was contacted about a month ago by a cleric's assistant. He then traveled to Turkey for a few days, returning to Russia with Rachabalizoda.[116][117] A leaked photograph showed Fariduni apparently being tortured by having his genitals shocked with a TA-57 field telephone.[118][119]

The suspects were officially identified as citizens of Tajikistan.[120] Mirzoyev, who was presented as the ringleader of the attacks, had an expired residency permit in Novosibirsk.[121] According to Agentstvo, three out of the four men had spent several months in Russia, but did not come to the attention of Russian authorities;[122] Meduza said that, according to one source, the alleged perpetrators met 3–4 weeks before the attack.[123] Izvestia alleged that two of the gunmen received instructions when travelling to Turkey.[124] An analysis by The New York Times matched the clothes of the four suspects with the gunmen in the attack.[58] If convicted, the four could receive a sentence of life imprisonment.[125]

On 25 March, three more suspects appeared in court and were placed in pre-trial detention until 22 May. They were identified as a father, Isroil Islomov, and his two sons, Aminchon Islomov and Dilovar Islomov, and were accused of aiding and abetting terrorism. Dilovar Islomov was the previous owner of the car in which the four suspected attackers fled the crime scene.[126]
